This project will explore and analyze the Airbnb dataset to discover key understandings. The dataset contains information on over 49,000 Airbnb listings in the United States. The goal of the project is to use this data to answer the following questions:

What are the most popular cities for Airbnb listings? What are the most popular types of Airbnb listings? How does the price of Airbnb listings vary by city, type of listing, and other factors? How are Airbnb listings rated by guests? What is the relationship between different factors in the dataset, such as the price of a listing and the number of reviews it has received?
